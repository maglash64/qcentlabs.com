      <description>Soo&amp;hellip;some time ago(like maybe 1-2 years?), I saw a video on youtube by the 8-bit guy where he showed how an optical mouse works.
He showed a really old mouse and was able to connect it to an old computer which ran BASIC. The he wrote a progam in BASIC to pixel grab data out of the sensor and display it on screen.
I was really amazed by this, But the image produced was very crude and the frame rate was very slow (more like spf instead of fps).</description>

      <description>Recently i got into USB device driver development for linux, I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to know how USB works at hardware as well as software level.
So i fired up google and looked up for USB specifications, and general documentation for it.
The best resource&amp;rsquo;s on the internet that i found were www.usbmadesimple.co.ukand the book USB complete by Jan Alexson.
The guys at usbmadesimple.co.uk explained the gist of USB in a very easy to understand manner, I highly recommend anyone going into USB to give it a go, then the book USB Complete gives detailed overview of every concept.</description>
