      <description>So few years ago NXP released a new series of MCU&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Cortex M on Steroids&amp;rdquo;.
Yeah, right.. They(NXP) weren&amp;rsquo;t joking when they released the IMX RT series of MCUs.
These are called crossover MCUs because they lie in between Application processors and normal MCUs,
Almost all of them feature atleast an ARM Cortex M7 core clocked at 500Mhz(some at 1Ghz+) or above for the consumer version.
Some like MIMXRT1160/1170 also include a ARM Cortex M4 alongside the 1Ghz M7!</description>

      <description>Soo&amp;hellip;some time ago(like maybe 1-2 years?), I saw a video on youtube by the 8-bit guy where he showed how an optical mouse works.
He showed a really old mouse and was able to connect it to an old computer which ran BASIC. The he wrote a progam in BASIC to pixel grab data out of the sensor and display it on screen.
I was really amazed by this, But the image produced was very crude and the frame rate was very slow (more like spf instead of fps).</description>

      <description>Recently i got into USB device driver development for linux, I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to know how USB works at hardware as well as software level.
So i fired up google and looked up for USB specifications, and general documentation for it.
The best resource&amp;rsquo;s on the internet that i found were www.usbmadesimple.co.uk and the book USB complete by Jan Alexson.
The guys at usbmadesimple.co.uk explained the gist of USB in a very easy to understand manner, I highly recommend anyone going into USB to give it a go, then the book USB Complete gives detailed overview of every concept.</description>

      <description>Hi!
My name is Ankit Sharma and I am an Embedded Systems Engineer!
I made this blog to share my journey as i explore the nooks and crannies of hardware and software.
I have a keen interest in knowing how things work under the hood.</description>
